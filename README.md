# Space3


No.1 Infrastructure for Developers-Support in under-represented communities. You can always rely on SPACE3 for fast-paced growth.
Space3 is an Nft project that seeks to grow web3 communities by building workspaces in rural areas to give web3 devs the needed capacity to build for the future of the internet. 

Proceeds from minting of NFT's would be used solely for the provision of electricity and constant internet and needed educational materials. 

This project tends to support web3 devs in rural areas having internet and electricity challange. This project made use of the of the following:

1. ERC721 Standard: For the NFT Contract
2. Polygon Mainnet: Deployed the NFT Contract here
3. Moralis: User Authentication, For getting users native balance and majorly for smart contract / execution or function call
4. Covalent: Made use of the ClassA API for getting getExternalNFTMetadata  to be display owners of NFT on the Frontend.
5. FileBase & IPFS : For storing the metadata of the NFTs



# How it works

1. Users are expected to mint NFT's as they will to support the growth of web3 ecosystem in Africa. Can only mint max of 10 in a transaction

2. Having minted, the total money available from minitng is made available on the front end and also the information of users that already minted using Covalent and Moralis

# Future of Space3

Looking forward to creating a DAO, where funds gathered are been decided upon by holders of the NFTs to decide profitable actions to take so as to increase revenue to achieve its fundamental objectives

From proceeds gained, we look forward to build a full grand event center that can accomodate maximum of 300 developers for web3 events as ETHDenver and all to further foster web3 growth and adoption in Africa.
